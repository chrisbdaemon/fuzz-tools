Coverage Collection Tools

================================================================================

lcov-reset.sh
Recursive reset of all coverage data collected thus far. Takes no arguments,
resets all in the current directory.

================================================================================

lcov-run-testcases-hourly.py
This Python script is designed to execute the code coverage command (again,
hardcoded in the script, will need to modify) for all test cases in a given
directory and create hourly results based on the last-access date for each test
case.

================================================================================

parse-summary.py
This script reads in the lcov summary data from "out" and writes the coverage
data to a CSV file: "summary.csv". The format is:

timestamp, line coverage %, function coverage %, branch coverage %

The command to generate the "output" file is:

for i in somedirectory/*.info; do lcov --summary -rc lcov_branch_coverage=1;
done >&! output"
